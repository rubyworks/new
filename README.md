= <%= title %>

"<%= title %>" is a empty Ruby project scaffold. To use it simply clone the repo
and run `reap`. Obviously that means you need to install `reap` first.

    $ gem install reap

So this is how it goes:

    $ git clone git://github.com/rubyworks/new.git project-name
    $ cd project-name
    $ reap

New is pretty opinionated, but over time it will become increasingly flexible.
